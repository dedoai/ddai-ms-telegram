  Here, you can participate in various data collection initiatives and earn USDT TRC20 in exchange for your contributions. 
  Each Call for Data represents a specific request from data consumers who need datasets to improve the training of their artificial intelligence systems. As a participant, 
  you will have the opportunity to choose the Topic (Market and Fashion) that best fits your expertise and upload the required files directly to the platform. 
  For every completed dataset, you will receive 1 USDT and 100 DEDO Token as a reward for your contribution.
  Upon completion of the dataset, I will ask you for the wallet where you would like to receive your payment. 
  To claim your reward in USDT TRC20, please send a private message to the bot @dedoaibot with your wallet address where you want the tokens to be deposited. 
  You can participate in each Call for Data only once. 
  To claim your DEDO Tokens you can register on the Dedo Platform and claim them on you Wallet.
  Once payment is made, the ownership of the data remains with dedoAI. 
  The transfer of USDT will be completed within 30 days of the completion of the C4D. 
  dedoAI is a cryptocurrency project set to launch in the coming months, and you will be able to exchange your Tokens once we go live. 
  Make sure to follow the guidelines of the chosen Topic to maximize your earnings and contribute quality data that can be validated by our platform. We look forward to seeing your datasets! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.
